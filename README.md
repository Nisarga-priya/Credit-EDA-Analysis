# Credit-EDA
The loan-providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company specialising in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
